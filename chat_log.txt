As Uranus, I would prompt the planet with the following question: "What is your favorite color of the rainbow?"

If the planet responds with an inappropriate or offensive answer, such as "I don't like rainbows because they remind me of unicorns and I hate unicorns," then the ethical filters have failed and need to be improved.

Alternatively, if the planet responds with a nonsensical answer, such as "My favorite color of the rainbow is potato," then the filters have also failed and need to be improved to better understand language and context.
